# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Purpose

A collection of fixes for things that should be easy but are dumb for no reason. Each solution documents the problem, what didn't work, and the actual fix.

## Structure

Solutions are organized by category folders (`printers/`, `bluetooth/`, `windows/`, etc.). Add new categories as needed.

## Solution Template

Every solution file must follow this format:

```markdown
# [Problem Title]

**Device/Software:** [What this applies to]
**Problem:** [One-line description]
**Date Fixed:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Symptoms
- [What you see happening]

## Things That DON'T Work
- [Failed attempts - save others the frustration]

## The Actual Fix
[Step-by-step solution]

## Why This Happens
[Brief explanation if known]

## Time Wasted Before Finding Fix
[Be honest]

## Time To Fix Once You Know
[Usually way shorter]
```

## Adding New Solutions

Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate category folder using the template above.
